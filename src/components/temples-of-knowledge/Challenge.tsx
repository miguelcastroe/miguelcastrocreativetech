          In Peru's remote highlands, where Quechua and Aymara are spoken, access to quality education is limited by scarce resources, high technology costs, and unreliable internet connectivity. Indigenous communities face additional barriers, as most educational tools fail to include native languages or respect their cultural context. These gaps perpetuate a cycle of inequality, leaving students without the tools to thrive in a rapidly advancing world.
